# Data Analyst course final project

Data used in this project comes from Kaggle, however for the purpose of the project data were uploaded on internar server of Coders Lab IT school. Row data can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations.

Scripts are written with Python. After webscrapping with API data were uploaded to Postgres server.

The business context of the project is as follows:

In this workshop, we will play the role of a consultant working for one of the air carriers, whose task is to optimize the process of providing and analyzing data. Recently, the carrier has been given access to data previously available only from an external application - a dedicated API service for downloading data has been made available. From the previous application, you could only download data manually. Moreover, the application had an additional limitation in the form of the number of exported rows. Due to the limits imposed in the application, data processing and analysis were extremely ineffective - requiring the involvement of many employees, which was additionally associated with a delay in providing data, resulting in a delay in making important decisions.

The client does not have its own unit responsible for data analysis. For this reason, he hired our employer to create a reporting and analytical system that will speed up the time of receiving data and eliminate the manual effort required to process the data.
